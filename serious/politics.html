okay. so. let's have a serious talk about politics, shall we? first of all, if you believe in religious governments, shut the fuck up. second, if you believe in radical conservatism, shut the fuck up. third, if you're a radical left, shut the fuck up. there shouldn't be any extremism at all, both of them shown us and proven to be untrustworthy and non-functional. also, conservatism should die. being anti-LGBT, anti-immigration, you should be put in preventive imprisonment. as a society, we should welcome everyone, from anywhere, no matter their sexual and gender orientation, their colour of skin, we shouldn't divide our People because of stupid beliefs. social progressism is the way. conservatism is for the scumbags. also, Free Palestine and Slava Ukraini.
