i've been feeling hopeless for months now, every talk i have with my parents about transitioning feels like wasted time, they want me to get friends but i hate my classmates and know nobody else irl outside of them, i WANT friends but i know none that i WANT as friends and i suck at pretending. i want real friends, not some stupid pretending bullshit that's as useful as nothing. anyways back to hrt, why is it so hard to convince my parents, i've already gone through my puberty so transitioning will be harder already, my parents make it harder. they want me to keep aging or else no hrt, they want me to be more socially open but WHERE, FUCKING WHERE, I HAVE NOBODY AND NOWHERE TO GO. fuck this shit, i hate this.
